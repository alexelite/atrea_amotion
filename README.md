# Atrea aMotion for Home Assistant
![Icon](assets/icon.png)

## About
This integration was inspired by and derived from the @xbezdick's [aMotion Atrea integration](https://github.com/xbezdick/amotionatrea/). 
It is designed to control Atrea HRV and ERV units that are equipped with the aMotion control system. The integration uses local websocket communication.

xbezdick's integration uses only a climate platform to control the unit, but this integration expands functionality by utilizing multiple platforms, such as climate in combination with fan, because the aMotion system is very complex, and relying solely on the climate platform is limiting in my opinion.
